# Transmon

### 1. Report on the building block of quantum computer, the transmon.

A report is produced using Jupyter notebook. However I ran into a problem where the pictures from my local docker image could not be shown properly in the report. I’m out of time, but hopefully I will have a chance to fix it.

The Jupyter notebook has the image embedded. However all the images are missing from the pdf file converted by Pandoc, named “Transmon Report”.

The GitHub version also has problem displaying some of the images embedded. :(

But at least some are showing up. It could be a problem with my markdown code.

### 2. Issues are opened in GitHub, and closed as each task is attempted. I don’t know how to do the listing on the Jupyter notebook however, so that task is still outstanding. I also added the issue of not being able to display the embedded images from the Jupyter notebook.
